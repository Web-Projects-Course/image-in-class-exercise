# In-class image exercise

This exercise is to get you some experience working with image formats.

### Working with JPEGs
JPEGs are the work horse of web graphics. They have been used for many purposes but they are still the best format for saving photgraphic imagery on the web.

We are going to take a look at how to size JPEGs for the web and what different compression levels look like. This is particularlly important for the larger images needed for high resolution displays like Apple's retina screens.

1. Open "Flamingo-Original.tif" It is currently a bit bigger than we need.
2. We are going to create 4 different **JPG** versions of this image. 
  * 342px × 512px (72ppi), low compression (quality level 12)
  * 683px × 1024px (144ppi), low compression (quality level 12)
  * 342px × 512px (72ppi), high compression (quality level 3)
  * 683px × 1024px (144ppi), low compression (quality level 3)
3. When viewed in index.html can you tell a difference between the images? Which ones?
4. What are the file sizes of the respective images?

### Working with PNGs
1. Use the image from the previous exercise and save it as an PNG. What is the file size difference?
2. Erase part of the image so it show transparency.
3. Save it again this time with transparency.

### Make a gif animation

2. Use keepvid to download it.
