# In-class image exercise

This exercise is to get you some experience working with image formats.

### Working with JPEGs
JPEGs are the work horse of web graphics. They have been used for many purposes but they are still the best format for saving photgraphic imagery on the web.

We are going to take a look at how to size JPEGs for the web and what different compression levels look like. This is particularlly important for the larger images needed for high resolution displays like Apple's retina screens.

1. Open image.jpg
2. We are going to create 4 different versions of this image
  * 72ppi low compression
  * 144ppi low compression
  * 72ppi high compression
  * 144ppi low compression
3. Using the test page can you tell a difference between the images? Which ones?
4. What are the file sizes of the respective images?
5. Save the image.jpg as a PNG. How does its file size compare?
6. Make part of the image transparent.

### Make a gif
1. Find a video on youtube you would like to create a GIF of
2. Use keepvid to download it
3. Import a selection of the video into photoshop
4. Create a frame animation an export as a GIF

### Working with SVGs
1. Open the test file with Illustrator
2. Save as SVG
3. Include it as IMG
4. Include it as object
5. Copy and paste it
